House Price Prediction

This project involves predicting house prices using a dataset containing various features of houses. The aim is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a house based on its features. The dataset includes features such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, lot size, and more.


Installation

1.Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/LakshanaSri17/house_price_prediction.git
2.Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

Project Steps

1.Data Exploration - explored the dataset to understand the features and the target variable.
2.Data Preprocessing - Normalize the data to ensure all features are on a similar scale.
3.Model Development - Developed a linear regression model to predict house prices. Experiment with different features and model parameters to optimize performance.
4.Model Evaluation - Evaluated the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
